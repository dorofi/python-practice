# Python Practice

A collection of simple and self-written Python scripts.  
Each file is a standalone mini-example for reinforcing programming skills.

## Script List

- `car_class_demo.py` â€” an example of creating a class and using methods.
- `age_check.py` â€” a simple conditional check that prints whether a person is an adult, teenager, or child based on their age (in Polish).
